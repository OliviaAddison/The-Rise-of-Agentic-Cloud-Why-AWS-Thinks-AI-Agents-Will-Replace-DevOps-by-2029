Many companies are adopting AI across <strong>software development</strong> &mdash; including DevOps tasks. According to a 2025 global survey, <strong>97.5% </strong>of organizations say they&rsquo;re integrating AI in their <strong>software development </strong>processes.<a href="https://techreviewer.co/blog/ai-in-software-development-2025-from-exploration-to-accountability-a-global-survey-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>Techreviewer<br></a>This widespread adoption supports the idea that by <strong>2029 AI agents</strong> could take over many traditional DevOps tasks &mdash; a shift envisioned by AWS and other cloud‑AI advocates.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What Is an &ldquo;Agentic Cloud&rdquo;?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Agentic cloud refers to cloud environments where <strong>AI agents</strong> autonomously manage infrastructure, deployments, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Unlike traditional DevOps &mdash; which depends on manual human intervention &mdash; <strong>AI agents</strong> can proactively predict issues, optimize resource usage, and even fix problems without prompt, cutting down deployment friction and human overhead.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine an <strong>AI agent built </strong>using an <a href="https://rubikchat.com/"><strong>AI agent builder</strong></a> &mdash; it monitors server load in real‑time, scales resources instantly, and sends you a clean summary of actions taken &mdash; all without manual involvement.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Why the Industry Thinks AI Agents Could Replace Traditional DevOps</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The data shows a clear trend toward automation and AI‑driven development workflows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As of <strong>2025, 72.2% </strong>of companies use AI for code generation. <a href="https://www.secondtalent.com/resources/ai-in-software-development-statistics/">Second Talent+1</a></p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>67.1% </strong>use AI for documentation or code review/optimization.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">AI-supported tasks are expanding beyond development &mdash; in <strong>2025,</strong> about <strong>38% </strong>of firms reported using AI specifically for DevOps automation. <a href="https://techreviewer.co/blog/ai-in-software-development-2025-from-exploration-to-accountability-a-global-survey-analysis">Techreviewer+1</a></p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Many teams say AI improved delivery speed: in a <strong>2025</strong> report on <strong>DevOps and testing, 46% </strong>of teams reported they now deploy code <strong>50%</strong> <strong>faster than in 2024.</strong></p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Overall, the global DevOps market &mdash; which as of <strong>2023</strong> was about <strong>USD 10.4 billion</strong> &mdash; is forecasted to grow at a <strong>CAGR of ~19.7%, </strong>reaching <strong>USD 25.5 billion </strong>by <strong>2028.&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All these show that AI and automation &mdash; central to the idea of agentic cloud &mdash; are not future fantasies but accelerating realities.</em></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How This Changes the Role of DevOps and IT Teams</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">AI agents won&rsquo;t instantly replace humans &mdash; but they will shift the nature of DevOps work. Rather than doing repetitive tasks (scaling, deployment, monitoring), engineers may increasingly:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Oversee AI‑agent behaviors (safety, resource use, compliance)</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Manage orchestration, architecture, and strategic decisions</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Build, customize, and maintain <strong>AI agents</strong> via platforms like<a href="https://rubikchat.com"> <strong>RubikChat</strong></a><strong> </strong>and other<strong> AI agent builders</strong></p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">For instance, firms using AI‑driven pipelines reported up to <strong>50%</strong> fewer deployment failures, more stable delivery, and faster feature rollouts.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Thus, instead of manual DevOps tasks, the job evolves into managing, supervising, and improving AI‑powered workflows &mdash; which often demands higher‑level skills.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Challenges and What to Watch Out For</h2><p dir="ltr">Despite the advantages, moving to agentic cloud and AI‑driven DevOps comes with caveats:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Not all companies have mature processes: </strong>among organizations using <strong>DevOps, </strong>only a segment (<em>about 14.1% in one survey</em>) consider themselves fully <em>&ldquo;cloud‑native DevOps unicorns.&rdquo;</em></p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>AI adoption is still uneven: </strong>even though nearly all companies now use AI somewhere in their SDLC, only a portion use it for DevOps automation or agentic tasks.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Skill and trust gaps: </strong>teams will need to adapt &mdash; shifting from manual tasks to supervising AI, ensuring safety, reliability, and dealing with edge‑case failures that only humans can catch.</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The rise of the agentic cloud is more than a prediction &mdash; current statistics suggest it's already underway.<br>By <strong>2029, AI agents</strong> may well handle a majority of routine DevOps operations &mdash; deployments, scaling, monitoring, continuous delivery &mdash; especially as tools like RubikChat and other <strong><a href="https://rubikchat.com/">AI agent development</a></strong> platforms mature.<br><em>For businesses and developers, that means:</em> stay ahead by learning to build, supervise, and <strong><em>manage AI‑agents</em></strong> rather than just traditional DevOps pipelines. Those who adopt early will likely gain major advantages in automation, speed, and scalability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
